Very basic website for a divorce counselor. 

This project consists of a front-end and back-end.

Front-end:

Just some information pages and a web form which posts JSON to the back-end service.

Back-end:

Receives the json from the front-end and sends 2 e-mails: one to the customer with the provided information. One to myself with very limited information, just to know how frequent the web form is used.

I just use Github as source code backup store. Probably nothing interesting for you guys here ;o)
